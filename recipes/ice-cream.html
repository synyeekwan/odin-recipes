    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Homemade Ice Cream recipe using only 3 ingredients blew my mind. I’ve seen recipes like this pop up before, but I was skeptical. Could it truly be that good?</p>
    <p>Well, I’m here to tell you—this ice cream is absolutely delicious, and the best part is that you don’t need an ice cream machine. With just three simple ingredients, you can whip up creamy, rich homemade ice cream in no time!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Cups Heavy Cream</li>
        <li>1 can Sweetened Condensed Milk 300ml</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a stand or hand mixer, whisk whipping cream for about 2 minutes. You want to create a stiff cream so don't rush this. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl whisk together the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Now scoop out 50% of the whipped cream into the condensed milk bowl. Using a rubber spatula gently fold the whipped cream into the condensed milk. Be gentle as we don't want to crush the whipped cream and force the air out. Now, fold the whipped cream + condensed milk combo into the remaining whipped cream. Fold gently and mix.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into a 5X9 inch loaf pan and place into the freezer for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove and scoop into waffle cones.</li>
    </ol>
