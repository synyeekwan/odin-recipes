    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These crispy butter cookies taste better than store-bought ones and are so easy to make. They are just 3 ingredients and don’t require any eggs. The cookies come out very crispy, buttery and sweet. They are perfect for gifting.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Cup butter</li>
        <li>1 Cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 Cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F.  Line 2 large baking sheets with silicone baking mat or parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add butter and sugar. Cream at highest speed for about 5 minutes or until light and fluffy. The mixture should turn from yellow to white and look like whipped cream when you are done.</li>
        <li>Add in the flour. Mix in at low speed and then gradually increase speed once flour is incorporated. The mixture will be crumbly at first but then should form a thick, soft dough, almost like a thick paste. You can stop mixing once the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Add dough to a piping bag. Using a large open star tip (I used one with a 1/2 inch opening), pipe swirls or whatever design you prefer. Space cookies 1 inch apart. See notes for other options if you don't wish to pipe the cookies. Place piped cookies into fridge for 30 minutes so the dough is chilled. This will prevent the cookies from spreading too much when they bake.</li>
        <li>Place one cookie sheet into the middle of your oven. Bake cookies for about 15-20 minutes or until edges and surface start to turn a light brown. (Mine took about 18-20 minutes). Remove cookies from oven and bake the second tray. Let cookies cool on cookie sheet before removing. Store uneaten cookies in an airtight container.</li>
    </ol>
