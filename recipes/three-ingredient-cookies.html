    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This easy cake is made with just 3 simple ingredients. It doesn’t contain any butter, oil or milk and doesn’t even need baking powder or baking soda. The cake comes out very light and airy and has a delicate sweet crackly surface. It is great for dessert or afternoon tea.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 Large Eggs</li>
        <li>1 Cup White Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Cup All-Purpose Flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease the interior of an 8 inch springform pan and then line it with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, add eggs and sugar. Beat on highest speed with wire whisk for about 8 minutes or until mixture becomes very thick and turns a very pale (almost white) yellow. </li>
        <li>Use a mesh strainer or flour sifter to sift in 1/3 of the flour. If you do not have a mesh strainer or sifter, you can use your hands to sprinkle the flour in. The goal is to break up the flour clumps when the flour is added so that it is easy to fold the flour into the egg mixture without deflating too much air from the egg mixture. Use a spatula to fold the flour into the egg mixture. Repeat with another 1/3 of the flour and then the final 1/3.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake for about 25-30 minutes. The surface of the cake should be light brown and be a solid shell/crust over the cake. A toothpick inserted should come out clean.</li>
        <li>Let cake cool completely before removing. Decorate with powdered sugar and/or fresh fruit like strawberries</li>
    </ol>
